# How do I contribute? ðŸ’ª

We're excited to have you on board!

As you can see from the [tsErrorMessages.json](https://github.com/mattpocock/ts-error-translator/blob/main/packages/engine/src/tsErrorMessages.json),
there's a serious amount of work that needs to be done to cover every possible Typescript Error. And that's when the open-source community really shines.

Your contributions will eventually help save countless hours for people struggling with TypeScript error messages.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js version installed, [latest LTS is recommended](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) (for installing npm dependencies, using yarn workspaces)

## How to start developing?

Clone the repo and install the needed dependencies for all the packages by following these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattpocock/ts-error-translator.git
cd ts-error-translator
yarn
yarn dev # This will run the next app
```

## Adding/editing error translations

You'll find all of the errors' translations at `packages/engine/errors` and they follow the following conventions:

- Every file must be named with its error code: `<code>.md`

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: To find the code for the error you're looking for, have a look inside [`tsErrorMessages.json`](https://github.com/mattpocock/ts-error-translator/blob/main/packages/engine/src/tsErrorMessages.json),
> or check your console, you'll see this formatting `error TS<code>: <msg>`.

- You can follow our template by running the following command. This will write an example file at `packages/engine/errors/<code>.md` with placeholders on how the explanation should be written.

```sh
yarn translate <code>
```

## Translation style guide

### You are the compiler

Similar to Elm, you should address the user as though _you are the compiler_.

Bad:

`TypeScript thinks that this is a type, not a variable.`

Good:

`I think that this is a type, not a variable.`

### Speak to the user directly

In a similar vein, you should address the user directly whenever possible - this keeps it conversational and terse.

Bad:

`The code might have an unnecessary trailing comma.`

Good:

`You might have added an unnecessary trailing comma.`

### Don't use `{0}` and `{1}` in excerpts

Excerpts should always be short and sweet - `{0}` can expand to _enormous_ size and make even our pretty excerpts unreadable. You can use 'A' and 'B' instead if you like.

Bad:

`{0} can't be passed to a slot expecting {1}.`

Good:

`'A' can't be passed to a slot expecting 'B'.`

## Contributing to a new language support

In order to add a new language youâ€™ll have to Identify the language information such as:

- Flag
- Language name
- [Language ID ([UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers))

Add the ID for the new language youâ€™re going to add at the config `apps/web/next.config.js`

And place the information needed at `apps/web/src/constants/languages.ts` as well.

### UI Translations

Once you added the language then you can add the UI translations at `apps/web/src/locales` following the same structure as the existing ones, also be sure to call the translations file with the ID you used for the language object.

For the translations to be applied youâ€™ll have to import the file at `apps/web/src/utils/translations.ts` and make the function handle the new language.

### Typescript error translations

Now that you translated the UI, you can also add a couple of translations to the Typescript error translated errors.

First step is create a new folder under the errors folder at `packages/engine/errors` and add a file with the error code as name, you can also follow the [Translation style guide](#translation-style-guide) to do this.
